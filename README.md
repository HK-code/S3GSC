# Dual-view superpixel graph subspace clustering (DV-SGSC) for large hyperspectral images
## Abstract
> The unique structure of hyperspectral image (HSI) provides rich information while also posing challenges for computation. Although subspace clustering is capable of effectively utilizing the high-dimensional features of hyperspectral imagery, its memory consumption expands dramatically with the growth of data volume, limiting its application on large datasets. In this paper, we propose a dual-view superpixel graph subspace clustering (DV-SGSC) that integrates the intrinsic graph structure of the superpixel spatial domain and the spectral domain. Firstly, superpixel segmentation is introduced to greatly reduce the amount of data without sacrificing accuracy, thus alleviating memory consumption problems caused by large datasets. Secondly, we ingeniously design a natural and logical method to create an intrinsic graph of superpixels in both spatial and spectral domains, which has been proven to be effective and essential. Finally, we present a joint optimization framework that can simultaneously process the spatial and spectral information of superpixels and obtain a unified self-expressive matrix. Experiments on four hyperspectral benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The code will be publicly available soon at [https://github.com/HK-code/DV-SGSC]{https://github.com/HK-code/DV-SGSC}.
