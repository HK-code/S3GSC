# Dual-view superpixel graph subspace clustering (DV-SGSC) for large hyperspectral images
## Abstract
> The unique structure of hyperspectral image (HSI) provides rich information while also posing challenges for computation. Although subspace clustering is capable of effectively utilizing the high-dimensional features of hyperspectral imagery, its memory consumption expands dramatically with the growth of data volume, limiting its application on large datasets.
